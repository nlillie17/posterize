Transform images using pixel clusters


I used an algorithim called k-means that uses a given paramter k, to estimate the given dataset. For instance, if k was 2, then the alorigthm figures out how to best represent the dataset with 2 datapoints. The higher k is, the closer the representative dataset is to the original. You can use the algorithim to manipulate picutres, to strip down the number of colors.

Using k-means on pictures, popular pixel colors are used for clustering. For instance, using a k of 2, the picture would be transformed to use only 2 colors that most represent the picture, or the array of pixels provided. 

I have attached some cool transformations below.
